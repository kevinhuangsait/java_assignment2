How to use: From the root folder of the project, type CMD into the explorer to open up the cmd window.
Type java -jar then use -f -t and -s as parameters for file name, compare type and sort type. 
v is volume, h is height, a is base aream b is bubble, s is selection, i is insertion, m is merge, q is quick and z is cocktail

example: java-jar sort.jar -fpolyfor1.txt -tv -sz

All functionalities are completed. Some sort methods run a bit too long on larger .txt files to reasonably wait for.
Basically 100%.
